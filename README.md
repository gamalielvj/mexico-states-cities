# Mexico-states-cities

Simple web application. I get all the data (JSON) of Mexico, States and Cities, and imported to a PostgreSQL database. Added a Person model just to interact with a form with filters select options by Country - States - Cities. (In this case is only Mexico, but you can add more data if you want, check it out ./db/seeds.rb).
